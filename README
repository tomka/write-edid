# write-edit

Writes EDID information over a given I2C-Bus to a monitor.

Use: 1. write-edid.sh <bus> <data>
     2. write-edid.sh <bus>

The second variant expects data on stdin.

You can find out the bus number with ic2detect -l. Address 0x50
should be available as the EDID data goes there.

This script expects ascii information representing chunks of hex data
as input. The bytewise presented data should be separated by spaces
and/or line breaks. For instance, this is the digital (!) EDID data
for a Samsung SyncMaster T220 monitor:

  00 FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 4C 2D E5 03 32 32 57 54
  0E 12 01 03 80 2F 1E 78 2A EE 91 A3 54 4C 99 26
  0F 50 54 BF EF 80 B3 00 81 80 81 40 71 4F 01 01
  01 01 01 01 01 01 7C 2E 90 A0 60 1A 1E 40 30 20
  36 00 DA 28 11 00 00 1A 00 00 00 FD 00 38 4B 1E
  51 0E 00 0A 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 00 00 FC 00 53
  79 6E 63 4D 61 73 74 65 72 0A 20 20 00 00 00 FF
  00 48 39 58 51 34 30 31 30 34 38 0A 20 20 00 45

Take care, you can destroy some hardware by messing around with i2c-tools.
The scripts expects root permissions.
